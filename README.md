The task that has been accomplished is control 5 servo motot and programm the circuit to turn all the 5 at 90 degree 



The equipement : 5 servo motor , 1 Arduino Uno R3 , 1 Small breadboard



The steps : 
        - Check that you already have The Eq. 
          (1) we have three wires in the servo ( Ground=black color  - Power=red color - Singal=green color )
          (2) Connect Power wires to 5V in the Arduino 
          (3) connect Ground wires to Grounf in the Arudino
          (4) connect Singal wires to the same pins (-9)
          (5) programm the arudino to make the servo turn ar 90 degree
